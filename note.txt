This is how you train
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3,4,5,6,7 python train.py 2 24 222 train

firstargs python train.py secondargs thirdargs fourthargs fifthargs

firstargs:
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3,4,5,6, -> explicitly mention what you want to use

secondargs:
how many gpus are you using across selected gpus

thirdargs:
if you say -1, you mean you wan tto train with everything you have else say 20 means use only 20 data points
this should be used only for sanity check

fourthargs:
number of epochs,
if thirdargs is -1, then you are using only 2 epochs

fifthargs:
specify if you are trainng or testing, train, test



HOW TO USE TENSORBOARD

tensorboard --logdir=logs/ --host=0.0.0.0

then portforward in termius and open your browser at 
localhost:6006/



Maintaining Version Control

every time you update something you will see green label
you need to push the changes
#remember in future you might have bigger files you don't want to push
#create .gitignore file and inlcude all the files that you don't want 
#see details in internet

git add --all
git commit -m "message"
git push -u origin main


# note you can log the terminal output for future reference as well
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,2 python train.py --version_data 0 --version_model 0 --version_catalog 0 --num_gpu 2 --train_batch_size 128 --test_batch_size 128 --mode train --sanity_epoch 2 | tee temp/history.txt

!!warninng above is for sanity check only
